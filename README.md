# Music Player Example

## Content
Project about a music player example developed with React (with Hooks), Typescript, Styled-Components and Jest.

I made this project with the aim of making an approach to how to work with Hooks and see the power that can have the styled-components library in my developments.

I'm open to any opinion or other alternatives to my code in order to improve it.

Note: To return data I use the API example of iTunes (Apple).

## Getting Started
